## Adventure Game
This project was developed through the Udacity - Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program.

Built with: Python.

#### Project description:
- Using Python to create an adventure game.
- The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
- Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
- Every time the game is played it chooses one of three random monsters for the story, so that it's a little different each time.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.

#### Instructions:
- Download or Clone the Repository.
- Using your favorite terminal go to the folder where the `Adventure_Game.py` file is in your computer.
- Run the `Adventure_Game.py` file by typing the command `python Adventure_Game.py`.
- For windows users I recommend using Git BASH as your terminal.
- If you use Git BASH before you run the `Adventure_Game.py` file you might need to first type the following command in your terminal `alias python='winpty python.exe'`.
